# Mophological-Opening-Closing-Net


With repeated request we have uploaded the code for the paper 
## Publication
"Image Restoration by Learning Morphological Opening-Closing Network" by Ranjan Mondal, Moni Shankar Dey,  and Bhabatosh Chanda

#Note
Please note that the code is not cleaned. All the research work including all the simulation(extra research work) is added here. We will 
clean the code and send pull request soon.
